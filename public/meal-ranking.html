<h1>The Best Meals According to Brittany</h1>
<h2>My top 3 meals of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Chicken Spaghetti</h3>
<p>Chicken spaghetti is a one dish recipe that is so easy and very delicious.</p>
<h3>Chicken and Rice burritos</h3>
<p>Chicken and rice burritos are the best meal prep meal. I can make a couple of weeks of burritos and freeze them. When we want them, reheat and add a sauce that you are feeling to change the flavor.</p>
<h3>Steak and artichokes</h3>
<p>M husband and I like to make steak and artichokes for our anniversary every year. It will always be a personal favorite!</p>
